Lab2

To compile each of the .c files, run the command

    gcc NewLab.c -std=c99 -o NewLab.exe

To run each of the files, run the command 

    ./NewLab.exe

The main program will print out a menu that will allow you to 
perform operations on a 2d linked list.
You must enter a digit into the menu from 0 to 8, anything else
will exit the program.
Exiting the program will delete all progress :)
